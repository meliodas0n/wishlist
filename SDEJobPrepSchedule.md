Focus: Tackle medium-level problems, deepen algorithmic understanding, and start system design basics.
- **Daily Schedule (2 hours)**:
  - 30 min: Study a new topic (e.g., Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Heaps) or revisit weak areas.
    - Resources: CTCI, LeetCode discuss section, Grokking the Coding Interview (Educative.io).
  - 60 min: Solve 1–2 medium LeetCode problems (focus on topics below).
    - If stuck, spend 20 min, then check hints/solutions and understand.
  - 30 min: Learn system design basics (15 min every other day, alternate with problem review).
    - Resources: Grokking the System Design Interview, YouTube (Tech Dummies, System Design Interview channel).
- **Weekly Goals**:
  - Week 9–10: Graphs (DFS, BFS), Heaps (8–10 medium problems)
  - Week 11–12: Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms (6–8 medium problems)
  - Week 13–14: Sliding Window, Intervals, Tries (6–8 medium problems)
  - Week 15–16: Backtracking, Advanced Trees (6–8 medium problems)
- **System Design Topics**:
  - Basics: Client-server model, REST APIs, databases (SQL vs. NoSQL).
  - Simple systems: URL shortener, chat app.
- **Milestone**: Solve 30–40 medium problems, understand system design fundamentals.

## Phase 3: Advanced Preparation & Mock Interviews (Days 121–180, ~2 Months)
Focus: Hard problems, system design fluency, behavioral interviews, and mock interviews.
- **Daily Schedule (2 hours)**:
  - 45 min: Solve 1 hard LeetCode problem or 2 medium problems (alternate days).
    - Focus on weak areas or mixed topics.
  - 30 min: System design practice (design a system or component, e.g., load balancer, caching).
    - Practice explaining designs aloud.
  - 30 min: Behavioral interview prep (every other day, alternate with coding review).
    - Use STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
    - Prepare answers for common questions: strengths, weaknesses, teamwork, conflict.
  - 15 min: Review past problems or optimize solutions.
- **Weekly Goals**:
  - Week 17–18: Advanced DP, Graph algorithms (5–7 hard problems)
  - Week 19–20: Mixed topics, contest-style problems (5–7 hard problems)
  - Week 21–22: System design (design 2–3 systems: e.g., YouTube, Uber)
  - Week 23–24: Mock interviews (2–3 per week via Pramp/Interviewing.io), polish resume.
- **System Design Topics**:
  - Complex systems: Social media feed, e-commerce platform.
  - Scalability, latency, consistency (CAP theorem).
- **Behavioral Prep**:
  - Prepare 5–7 stories covering leadership, problem-solving, failure.
  - Practice concise storytelling (1–2 min per answer).
- **Milestone**: Solve 15–20 hard problems, complete 6–8 mock interviews, confidently explain 3–4 system designs.

## Weekly Schedule Template
| Day       | Hour 1 (60 min)                       | Hour 2 (60 min)                       |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Monday    | Learn concept + 1 problem             | Solve 1 problem + review              |
| Tuesday   | Solve 1–2 problems                    | System design (or review)             |
| Wednesday | Learn concept + 1 problem             | Solve 1 problem + review              |

## Additional Tips
- **Track Progress**: Use a spreadsheet to log problems solved, topics covered, and weak areas.
- **Stay Consistent**: 2 hours daily is enough if focused; avoid burnout by taking 1 rest day every 2 weeks.
- **Apply Early**: Start applying to jobs in Month 5, even if not fully ready, to gain interview experience.
- **Network**: Connect with recruiters on LinkedIn, attend virtual tech meetups.
- **Resume**: Tailor resume to highlight projects, skills (e.g., 1–2 personal projects using algorithms or system design).

## Final Milestone (Day 180)
- Solved 100–120 problems (50 easy, 40 medium, 15–20 hard).
- Designed 5–7 systems confidently.
- Completed 8–10 mock interviews.
- Prepared 5–7 polished behavioral stories.
- Applied to 50+ companies, with 3–5 interview calls scheduled.
